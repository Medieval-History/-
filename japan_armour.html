                        The Dō-maru first appeared during the Gempei Wars, worn by foot soldiers, but it really took off in the 14th century when battles became more common in cities and on foot.

Unlike the Ō-yoroi, which was heavy and designed for mounted warriors, the Dō-maru was lighter, more flexible, and easier to move in. Its skirt (kuzazuri) was split into more sections, giving soldiers better mobility. It also had fewer armor plates and wasn’t as flashy as the Ō-yoroi, making it a more practical choice for battle.

                        Worn by the samurai and upperclass Japanese officials in the Gempei wars (1180-1185) and against the invasion of the Mongols (1271-1281).

Suited for mounted archers and cavalry men. Made of thousands of small scales (kozanes) made of iron or leather laced together with braided silk or leather cords. Very heavy and box-like. Known for its beautiful, unique design.
