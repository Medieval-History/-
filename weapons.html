                        A major advancement in ranged technology, they were cheaper than cavilary, and used a string tied to a curved piece of wood to shoot arrows. Earlier designs had range reaching 100 metres. Having 3 major advancements being long bow, composite bow and crossbow.
                        <div class="text-gray-600 mt-2 text-lg"><em> Composite Bow </em> 
                            The composite bows had a range reaching 100m-275m. They had high power and were really effecient.</div>
                        <div class="text-gray-600 mt-2 text-lg"><em> Longbows </em> 
                            Typically attributed to the welsh, however use has been found in Northern Europe in as early as the dark ages. They are known to reach the ranges of 275-400m. They allowed for massive draw-strength and quick reloads.</div>
                            <div class="text-gray-600 mt-2 text-lg"><em> Crossbow </em> 
                                Originating in China, the crossbow became really common in Europe in the 13th century. First being made of wood which allowed it to be cocked by hand, but later on the crossbows needed more strength, and we saw the dawn off steel crossbows, even needing mechanical components. However that was not the biggest drawback, it had a really long reload speed, but the abilty to pierce armour was a really big strength.</div>
