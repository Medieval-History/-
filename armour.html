                            Chainmail armor is a type of armor that has metal rings and leather sown together.
                            Due to chainmail armor not proving to be useful against crossbows, plated body armor started to form. It is iron plates sown onto leather armor, it however was still pointless against crossbows. Although because of this full faceguards were created.

                            Full faceguards were developed to protect the head from all attacks, these were espacially handy against long range projectiles that could pierce like crossbows and the longbows of the time.
                            In the late 14 century the development of full plate armour started to gain popularity over chainmail and plate armour sown on to leather.
                            The 14 century also led to the development of bascinet a close fitting helmet that had a moveable visor.

                            During the evolution of medieval armor, protective plates were gradually introduced to cover the shins, knees, thighs, hands, shoulders, elbows, and outer arms. The torso was reinforced with riveted plates inside a leather doublet and brigandine, while chainmail covered vulnerable gaps. This armor was highly effective, as its rounded plates deflected blows rather than absorbing them, and the brigandine offered strong resistance against slashes and piercing attacks. However, it still had weaknesses—inner arms remained unprotected, leaving them exposed to enemy strikes, and the lack of neck protection posed a serious risk.

    By 1548, these vulnerabilities were addressed. The arms were fully encased in plates, elbows were safeguarded by coudières, shoulders were reinforced with rounded pauldrons, and gauntlets became entirely metal. The torso was now protected by solid, shaped plates, and the upper thighs and pelvis were shielded by segmented tuille plates.

    Despite the extensive plating, knights were not as immobile as commonly believed. The armor was designed for both protection and mobility. However, as gunpowder weapons advanced, even the most durable armor became ineffective, leading to its decline.
