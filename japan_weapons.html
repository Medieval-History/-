                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                        The katana was a sword with a blade between 2-3 feet with a single sharp curved edge for enhanced slashing ability. It is the most known of medieval Japanese weapons and the samurai's signature weapon.
                        The blade was made of high-carbon hard steel on the edge, low-carbon soft steel at the core, and medium-carbon steel in different arrangements for stability. The handle was made of wood and wrapped with stingray skin and silk cord or leather strips, usually decorated with precious metals and gems.

                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                        The wakazashi and tanto were sidearms meant to be used in conjunction with a katana. The wakazashi was a curved blade ranging from 1-2 feet in length, often used as a pair known as a daisho.
                        The tanto was a long knife about 1 foot in length, made of high-carbon steel for strength and sharpness.

                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
                        The yari is a lance-like spear ranging from 8-18 feet.
                        It replaced the bow in the samurai arsenal during the 1300s due to its versatility in offensive and defensive situations. Its length was adjusted to counter cavalry effectively.
                        The yari spear was essentially a small blade on a long wooden staff.

                        The medieval Japanese bow was asymmetrical and about 6 feet long.
                        It was the primary weapon of the samurai until the 1300s, used mainly on horseback. Samurai trained extensively with the bow through competitions and difficult challenges.
                        Made of lighter wood, the Japanese bow was easier to wield compared to its European counterpart.
